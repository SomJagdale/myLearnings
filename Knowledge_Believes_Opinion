### **Understanding Knowledge, Belief, and Opinion**  
These three concepts are related but have key differences in how we understand and interact with the world.  

---

### **1️⃣ Knowledge** (Objective & Justified)  
🔹 **Definition**: Knowledge is **justified true belief**—it is something we accept as **true with evidence**.  
🔹 **Characteristics**:  
   ✅ Based on facts, logic, or proof.  
   ✅ Can be tested and verified.  
   ✅ Less likely to change unless new evidence arises.  
🔹 **Example**:  
   - *“The Earth orbits the Sun.”* (This is scientifically proven and widely accepted.)  

---

### **2️⃣ Belief** (Subjective & Personal)  
🔹 **Definition**: A belief is something **we accept as true**, even if it lacks full evidence.  
🔹 **Characteristics**:  
   ✅ Can be personal or collective.  
   ✅ May or may not be based on facts.  
   ✅ Can be influenced by emotions, upbringing, and culture.  
🔹 **Example**:  
   - *“Hard work always leads to success.”* (This is widely believed but not always objectively true in every case.)  

---

### **3️⃣ Opinion** (Subjective & Debatable)  
🔹 **Definition**: An opinion is a **personal interpretation or judgment** about something, often influenced by beliefs.  
🔹 **Characteristics**:  
   ✅ Based on perspective, experience, or preference.  
   ✅ Can vary from person to person.  
   ✅ Not necessarily based on facts.  
🔹 **Example**:  
   - *“Chocolate ice cream is the best flavor.”* (This is a personal preference, not an objective fact.)

### **How Are They Connected?**  
✔ **Knowledge** is based on **facts**.  
✔ **Belief** is something you accept as true, even without proof.  
✔ **Opinion** is a **judgment or viewpoint** based on knowledge or belief.  

📌 **Example Connecting All Three:**  
- **Knowledge**: "Exercise improves health." (Proven by research)  
- **Belief**: "Running is the best way to stay fit." (May be true for some but not for all)  
- **Opinion**: "Morning workouts are better than evening ones." (Personal preference)
