Awesome question!
Your brain is constantly scanning for patterns when learning or using English (or any language). Here’s a list of the key pattern types your brain picks up—consciously or subconsciously:

⸻

1. Phonetic Patterns (Sounds)
	•	How words are pronounced
	•	Example: “th” in think, that
	•	You learn that “ough” can sound like off (cough), ow (plough), or oo (through)

⸻

2. Grammar Patterns (Structure)
	•	Subject-Verb-Object: “She eats an apple.”
	•	Tense changes: “I go” → “I went”
	•	Question formation: “Do you like it?”
	•	Passive voice: “The book was written by her.”

⸻

3. Vocabulary and Word Family Patterns
	•	Recognizing root words: act, action, active, actor
	•	Prefixes/Suffixes: un-, re-, -ness, -tion
	•	Brain learns how adding a prefix/suffix changes meaning.

⸻

4. Sentence Rhythm and Intonation
	•	English has a stress-timed rhythm—some syllables are emphasized more.
	•	Example: “I didn’t say he stole the money” (Emphasis changes meaning)

⸻

5. Word Order Patterns
	•	Adjective before noun: “beautiful day”
	•	Question words first: “Where are you going?”
	•	Time indicators at the end: “I’ll call you tomorrow.”

⸻

6. Collocation Patterns (Words That Go Together)
	•	Brain notices that some words “stick” together:
	•	Make a decision, not “do a decision”
	•	Heavy rain, not “strong rain”
	•	Take a break, not “have a break”

⸻

7. Idiomatic Patterns (Non-literal Phrases)
	•	“Break the ice”, “hit the sack”, “piece of cake”
	•	These are learned as fixed expressions, not word-by-word.

⸻

8. Discourse Patterns (How Ideas Flow)
	•	Topic sentence → supporting details → conclusion
	•	Storytelling structure: beginning, conflict, climax, resolution

⸻

In Summary:

Your brain becomes a master of spotting:
Sound patterns, grammar structures, word pairings, rhythm, and idea flow—and it automates them over time with exposure and practice.
