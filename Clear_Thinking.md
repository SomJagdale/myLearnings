The relationship between **what**, **how**, and **why** is indeed significant, as they form a triad that addresses different dimensions of understanding, communication, and problem-solving. Here's a structured breakdown of their interplay:

### 1. **Interdependence and Hierarchy**:
   - **What**: Identifies the subject, object, or concept (e.g., "What is this?"). It establishes the foundation by defining the topic.
   - **How**: Explores the process, mechanism, or method (e.g., "How does it work?"). It builds on the "what" to describe functionality.
   - **Why**: Delves into purpose, cause, or motivation (e.g., "Why does this exist?"). It provides deeper context or reasoning, often rooted in goals or principles.

   Together, they create a hierarchy of understanding:  
   **What** (description) → **How** (process) → **Why** (purpose).  
   Alternatively, in motivational contexts (e.g., Simon Sinek's *Golden Circle*), the order reverses: **Why** (purpose) → **How** (values/method) → **What** (outcome).

### 2. **Contextual Application**:
   - **Scientific Inquiry**: Often progresses as *What* (observation) → *How* (experimentation) → *Why* (theory).  
   - **Business/Leadership**: Prioritizes *Why* (vision/mission) → *How* (strategy) → *What* (product/service).  
   - **Education/Communication**: Starts with *What* (definition) → *How* (application) → *Why* (significance) to scaffold learning.

### 3. **Holistic Understanding**:
   - **Descriptive** (*What*): Grounds the subject in reality.  
   - **Procedural** (*How*): Explores mechanics or methodology.  
   - **Explanatory** (*Why*): Uncovers meaning, intent, or causality.  
   Missing any element risks an incomplete perspective. For example, knowing *what* a smartphone is and *how* it works is enriched by understanding *why* it was designed (e.g., connectivity, user experience).

### 4. **Philosophical and Practical Roles**:
   - **What** and **How** are often empirical or technical, while **Why** bridges to philosophy, ethics, or motivation.  
   - In innovation, *Why* drives creativity, *How* translates ideas into action, and *What* manifests the result.

What to Choose for Your Technical Interview:

For your technical interview, you should aim to demonstrate your understanding across all three levels: What, Why, and How. However, the emphasis might shift depending on the question and the interviewer's focus.

Here's a guideline:

Start with the "**What**": When you encounter a technical question, begin by clearly defining the concept, technology, or problem. This shows a foundational understanding.
Example: If asked about "RESTful APIs," start by explaining what a RESTful API is (architectural style, principles like statelessness, etc.).


Immediately move to the "**Why**": After defining the "What," explain why it's important, why it's used, or why certain design choices are made. This demonstrates deeper understanding and critical thinking.
Example (continuing): Explain why REST is popular (scalability, flexibility, ease of integration) or why certain REST principles are important (statelessness for scalability).


Conclude with the "**How**": Finally, delve into the implementation details and the "how-to." This showcases your practical skills and ability to apply your knowledge.
Example (continuing): Explain how different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used in REST, how data is typically exchanged (JSON, XML), or how you would design a specific REST endpoint.


Great question, Somnath — confidence in a technical interview doesn’t come just from “knowing everything,” but from being **prepared, structured, and composed under pressure**. Here’s how you can build that confidence practically:

---

### ✅ 1. **Know Your Projects Inside-Out**
- Be crystal clear on **WHAT you did**, **HOW you did it**, and **WHY it mattered**.
- Prepare 2–3 key projects with real numbers (latency reduced by X%, scaled to Y users, etc.).
- Have stories ready: one where you **solved a tough problem**, and one where you **worked with a team**.

> ✍️ Example: “In our network traffic redirection project, I optimized signaling flow using SS7, which reduced packet loss by 30%.”

---

### ✅ 2. **Practice Common Patterns**
- Review patterns in:
  - System design (scalability, availability, partitioning)
  - Code logic (DFS, BFS, recursion, sliding window)
  - Tools (Kubernetes, Helm, Vault, Kafka, Elasticsearch)
- **Repetition** = confidence. Write, run, and explain small problems daily.
  
---

### ✅ 3. **Use a Structured Answer Format**
Use the **WHAT → HOW → WHY** format we discussed. It keeps your answers:
- Logical
- Clear
- Professional

And when needed, flip to **WHY → HOW → WHAT** for decision-based questions.

---

### ✅ 4. **Talk Through Your Thought Process**
Interviewers want to **hear your thinking**, not just the final answer. Say things like:
- “Let me break that down.”
- “My first thought is to use X, but let me walk through it…”
- “We considered Y, but chose Z because…”

This shows confidence even if you’re unsure.

---

### ✅ 5. **Prepare for the Unknown**
Even top engineers get questions they don’t know. What sets confident people apart:
- They **stay calm**.
- They say:  
  > “I haven’t used this directly, but based on what I know…”  
  > “I would approach it by…”

---

### ✅ 6. **Mock Interviews / Speak Aloud Practice**
- Practice out loud. Record yourself if needed.
- Use platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io, or even just a friend or AI (happy to help!).
- Confidence grows when your brain gets used to **saying it out loud under mild stress**.

---

### ✅ 7. **Mindset Shift: It’s a Conversation, Not a Test**
You're not being grilled. You’re **collaborating to solve a problem** or **share your experience**. Shift from “Am I good enough?” to “Let me show you how I think.”

---

### ⚡ Summary:
| Step | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1. Master your own projects | Be fluent with what you did |
