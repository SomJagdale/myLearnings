The relationship between **what**, **how**, and **why** is indeed significant, as they form a triad that addresses different dimensions of understanding, communication, and problem-solving. Here's a structured breakdown of their interplay:

### 1. **Interdependence and Hierarchy**:
   - **What**: Identifies the subject, object, or concept (e.g., "What is this?"). It establishes the foundation by defining the topic.
   - **How**: Explores the process, mechanism, or method (e.g., "How does it work?"). It builds on the "what" to describe functionality.
   - **Why**: Delves into purpose, cause, or motivation (e.g., "Why does this exist?"). It provides deeper context or reasoning, often rooted in goals or principles.

   Together, they create a hierarchy of understanding:  
   **What** (description) → **How** (process) → **Why** (purpose).  
   Alternatively, in motivational contexts (e.g., Simon Sinek's *Golden Circle*), the order reverses: **Why** (purpose) → **How** (values/method) → **What** (outcome).

### 2. **Contextual Application**:
   - **Scientific Inquiry**: Often progresses as *What* (observation) → *How* (experimentation) → *Why* (theory).  
   - **Business/Leadership**: Prioritizes *Why* (vision/mission) → *How* (strategy) → *What* (product/service).  
   - **Education/Communication**: Starts with *What* (definition) → *How* (application) → *Why* (significance) to scaffold learning.

### 3. **Holistic Understanding**:
   - **Descriptive** (*What*): Grounds the subject in reality.  
   - **Procedural** (*How*): Explores mechanics or methodology.  
   - **Explanatory** (*Why*): Uncovers meaning, intent, or causality.  
   Missing any element risks an incomplete perspective. For example, knowing *what* a smartphone is and *how* it works is enriched by understanding *why* it was designed (e.g., connectivity, user experience).

### 4. **Philosophical and Practical Roles**:
   - **What** and **How** are often empirical or technical, while **Why** bridges to philosophy, ethics, or motivation.  
   - In innovation, *Why* drives creativity, *How* translates ideas into action, and *What* manifests the result.

What to Choose for Your Technical Interview:

For your technical interview, you should aim to demonstrate your understanding across all three levels: What, Why, and How. However, the emphasis might shift depending on the question and the interviewer's focus.

Here's a guideline:

Start with the "**What**": When you encounter a technical question, begin by clearly defining the concept, technology, or problem. This shows a foundational understanding.
Example: If asked about "RESTful APIs," start by explaining what a RESTful API is (architectural style, principles like statelessness, etc.).


Immediately move to the "**Why**": After defining the "What," explain why it's important, why it's used, or why certain design choices are made. This demonstrates deeper understanding and critical thinking.
Example (continuing): Explain why REST is popular (scalability, flexibility, ease of integration) or why certain REST principles are important (statelessness for scalability).


Conclude with the "**How**": Finally, delve into the implementation details and the "how-to." This showcases your practical skills and ability to apply your knowledge.
Example (continuing): Explain how different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used in REST, how data is typically exchanged (JSON, XML), or how you would design a specific REST endpoint.
