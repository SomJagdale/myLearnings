The C.A.L.M. Negotiation Framework

(A Simple, Practical Daily Framework Inspired by Top Negotiation Books)

This framework combines key principles from books like Never Split the Difference (Chris Voss), Getting to Yes (Roger Fisher), and Influence (Robert Cialdini). It helps you practice negotiation daily, whether in business, personal life, or leadership.

C.A.L.M. – The Daily Negotiation Practice Framework

Each time you negotiate (salary, project deadlines, discounts, team decisions, etc.), follow these four steps:

1. C – Clarify Interests (Not Positions)
	•	What to Do: Before negotiating, ask yourself:
	•	What do I really want? (e.g., higher salary, more time, respect)
	•	What does the other person actually want? (e.g., cost-saving, flexibility, commitment)
	•	Why? This helps you move beyond fixed positions (“I want a raise” vs. “No budget”) and find win-win solutions.
	•	Daily Practice:
	•	Before any request or argument, pause and write down both your and the other person’s interests.
	•	Example: If negotiating a deadline with your manager, don’t just say, “I need more time.” Instead, understand their need for delivery speed vs. quality trade-offs.

2. A – Ask Tactical Questions & Label Emotions
	•	What to Do: Use calm, open-ended questions to guide the conversation.
	•	How?
	•	Instead of: “Give me a raise.”
	•	Say: “What would need to happen for me to get a raise?”
	•	Instead of: “I can’t meet this deadline.”
	•	Say: “What’s the most critical part of this deadline?”
	•	Bonus: Label emotions like Chris Voss suggests:
	•	“It seems like you’re under a lot of pressure to get this done fast.” (This makes them feel heard.)
	•	Daily Practice:
	•	Every conversation, replace demands with calm, open-ended questions that make the other person think.

3. L – Leverage the Power of Silence & Reciprocity
	•	What to Do:
	•	Pause after key points. (Silence makes people uncomfortable, and they often reveal more.)
	•	Give before you ask. (If you help first, they’ll feel obligated to return the favor.)
	•	Example:
	•	After asking for something (like better project terms), stay silent—don’t rush to fill the gap.
	•	Offer small help first: “I can adjust my timeline if we can add [your need] in return.”
	•	Daily Practice:
	•	Next time you ask for something, pause for 3-5 seconds after your request.
	•	Notice how people react and often offer more.

4. M – Make a No-Lose Offer
	•	What to Do: Instead of ultimatums, give a choice where both options benefit you.
	•	How? Use the “Either-Or” Method:
	•	“Would you prefer a lower price with longer delivery time, or a faster delivery at the current price?”
	•	“Would you like to start with a small test project before committing long-term?”
	•	Why? This avoids deadlocks and makes people feel in control.
	•	Daily Practice:
	•	Whenever negotiating, offer 2-3 choices, making it easier for the other person to say yes.

	1.	Morning: Before key conversations, clarify your and their interests.
	2.	During Conversations: Use open-ended questions, label emotions, and leverage silence.
