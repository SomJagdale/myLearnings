Before taking issue for sprint make sure below points
1. Is this issue got replicated?
2. Do we have enough data from the site to take this in a sprint
3. We will request all necessory data from site within initial 7 days.
4. If we dont get any one from 1st and 2nd point we should make this a red
5. Developer should udpate the RAG status
6. If you give more work to TL, he will be a team member not a tech lead. He will not get bandwidh to help other team members and QE.
7. more time for documentations and jira items
8.

Actvites to work on bugs
	Going throguth JIRA details, 
	Going through Email chain
	Going roamertrace, NTR.log 
	Understanding the source code
	Getting setup ready for replicate including same tag and databse 
	Replicating the issue 
	Finding out the route cause 
	Fixing the bug 
	Check-in fix in different branches 

Analysis based on below logs 
Request necessory setup details, including NTR Version, RTag, and Database in use etc. OR you can ask them to run the following commands to collect essential setup detail
                networktr -v
      cat /etc/os-release
      file networktr
      ldd networktr(if required)
Check if there have been recent updates or changes to labels or configurations on the site that might triggered the issue.
Ask if user have made configuration changes or if there have been major system activities just before the issue was observed.
Inquire about how frequently the issue is happening. Is it a recurring problem, or is it in-consistent?
Check if the issue is specific to particular IMSIs, networks, zones, or nodes.
Determine if the issue occurs during high or low traffic loads.
Request relevant logs, including Roametrace, NTR, Trap, and KPI logs.
Ask for configuration details, such as TR.cfg, fsmpapp.properties, system parameters, network settings, and cos details. These can get from site's cache dumps.
For more information you can request pcaps, rwmonitors, ptrace, and core dumps (for C++ applications).
As per me best way to resolve the issue is to replicate it in a dev env. Try to recreate the same scenario case that triggered the issue on the site.
While replicating issue try to match dev setup to site setup.
If possible check the traces traffic source entities like DRA, IPProbe and SSTP
Check whether the issue has a functionality impact or any revenue leakage.

The new operator can be overloaded, whereas the malloc function cannot.
If there is not enough memory, the new operator throws an exception, whereas the malloc function returns null.
The return type of the new operator is of the same type for which the memory was allocated. We don't need to do typecasting.
The new operator automatically computes the size of the data object. We don't need to use the sizeof() operator.
The new operator allows us to initialize objects while creating memory space for them.

When setting up your .bashrc file for developers, you can include useful Bash commands and aliases to enhance productivity and provide shortcuts for common tasks. Here are some useful commands and aliases that developers often add to their .bashrc file:

Git Aliases: Create aliases for common Git commands to save typing and improve productivity.
bash
Copy code
# Git aliases
alias gs='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit'
alias gco='git checkout'
alias gb='git branch'
alias gl='git log'
alias gp='git pull'
alias gps='git push'
Directory Navigation Aliases: Create shortcuts for frequently used directories.
bash
Copy code
# Directory navigation aliases
alias projects='cd ~/projects'
alias documents='cd ~/Documents'
alias downloads='cd ~/Downloads'
alias desktop='cd ~/Desktop'
Clear Screen Shortcut: Create an alias to quickly clear the terminal screen.
bash
Copy code
alias cls='clear'
Colorful ls: Add colors to the ls command for better visibility.
bash
Copy code
# Colorful ls
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
Show Hidden Files: Create an alias to show hidden files in ls command.
bash
Copy code
alias lsa='ls -a'
Confirmation for rm: Add a confirmation prompt to the rm command.
bash
Copy code
alias rm='rm -i'
Useful Development Tools: Include aliases for development tools you frequently use.
bash
Copy code
# Development tools
alias python='python3'
alias py='python3'
alias npm='npm --no-optional'
Custom Functions: Add custom functions for common tasks.
bash
Copy code
# Custom function to create a new directory and navigate into it
mkcd() {
    mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}
Environment Variables: Set up environment variables for development tools.
bash
Copy code
export JAVA_HOME="/path/to/java"
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/bin"
Remember to customize these commands and aliases to fit your specific development workflow. After adding the desired commands and aliases to your .bashrc file, you can apply the changes immediately by running:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.bashrc
This will enable the new commands and aliases in your current terminal session.

https://www.quora.com/Where-are-virtual-tables-stored-in-C

Some things to note:

the “vtable for S” and the global variable s are defined similarly, which is as expected since they’re both global variables
unlike the global variable s, the “vtable for S” is in a special “.rodata” section where “rodata” means “read-only data”
unlike the global variable s, the “vtable for S” is declared .weak which means that this definition can appear “in duplicate” in other object files; that ensures that having similar code in other translation units won’t cause linker errors
the size of the global variable s is 8, which is the space needed to hold a pointer to the “vtable for S”
the “vtable for S” points not only to the virtual functions of S (S::f in this case), but also to another implicit global variable known as “typeinfo for S” (that address is, e.g., produced by the expression typeid(S))
the line “.quad 0” in the definition for “vtable for S” is used to implement dynamic_cast<void*>, which returns a pointer to “the most-derived object”; the value 0 is the offset from the pointer to the virtual table to the beginning of the most derived object — you’d need a case involving multiple inheritance to make it non-zero in this ABI


As other answers point out, it’s for maximum efficiency.

Pro-tip : every C compiler I’ve ever come across will initialize pointers to NULL in debug mode.

So if your release build blows up but your debug build doesn’t, it’s not a quantum thing where the bug disappears through the act of observing it. It’s a reference to an uninitialized pointer.

Ten thoughts for who is starting their C++ journey:

1. Move semantics is not mandatory - it is optional; You don't even need to be aware of move semantics to use all the potential of the C++ language and unleash all power of modern optimizing compilers

2. Move semantics was created to deal with a niche case of very large objects (matrices and images) in the 2000s and was generalized to everything by skilled propaganda; small objects do not benefit from move semantics

3. Move semantics is an all-in or all-out issue - you have to pick a side before you start writing code; you cannot use it half-way.

4. However if you use it once, you need to MASTER everything: prvalue, xvalue, glvalue, && and variants, std::move, std::forward, perfect forwarding etc

5. Learning move semantics half way is a recipe for disaster as evidence mounts for its dangerous misuse which often backfires dramatically.

6. Move semantics will introduce a lot of unnecessary complexity and boilerplate into your code (rule of 5); weight the tradeoff vis-a-vis maintenance by more junior members of the team; for managers this means your hiring pool will be shrunk by half or more

7. You definitely do not need move semantics to write ultra low latency code. In fact you might be better off without it, there are alternative techniques that are simpler, faster and better

8. In fact, most performance applications I know (mostly gaming and trading ) sidestep move semantics altogether

9. Shared pointers, and intrusive ones in particular, render move semantics unnecessary

10. unique_ptr asks for move semantics; shared_ptr avoids it

Pick the red or the blue pill.

According to me, you don't need a hundred resources if you just thoroughly focus on a few, understand them well and keep practicing.

mutex vs monitor thread
dead lock condition

A vtable is created when a class declaration contains a virtual function. A vtable is introduced when a parent -- anywhere in the heirarchy -- has a virtual function, lets call this parent Y. Any parent of Y WILL NOT have a vtable

If your goal is to convince the person you're arguing against, then you have to be much more careful about it.
 The key is this: NEVER try to make them admit that they're wrong.
 If you do, then sheer pride will keep them from agreeing with you, even in the face of all logic.
 My favorite approach is to find something in their argument I agree with, even if you're just agreeing that the earth is round. 
 Acknowledge their points and their rightness. Then frame your arguments as just a modification on the points they're making, and 
 argue for your side, presenting it as a compromise between your points of view.

Overloaded "&&" and "||" operators lose their short-circuit evaluation property.

the process of reorganizing common behavior from non-abstract classes into "abstract classes" using inheritance to abstract over sub-classes
 as seen in the object-oriented C++ and Java programming languages.

Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. 
 It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running
Template metaprogramming (TMP) is a metaprogramming technique in which templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code, 
 which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled. 

How Strong type checking implemented in c++? :D
In 1979, Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, 
 including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.
In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C), adding new features that included virtual functions,
 function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type 
 checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes
In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991.[16] New features in 2.0 
 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. 
In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions 
included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a boolean type.


Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles:[13]

It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs.
Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).
Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++.
Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++.
It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.
No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).
User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types.
Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance).
There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language).
C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment.
If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.

2.1	Object storage
2.1.1	Static storage duration objects
2.1.2	Thread storage duration objects
2.1.3	Automatic storage duration objects
2.1.4	Dynamic storage duration objects

Static storage duration objects are initialized in two phases. First, "static initialization" is performed, and only after all static 
initialization is performed, "dynamic initialization" is performed. In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros;
 after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized
 with a literal or constexpr). 
Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data 
partition of the executable. Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless 
the function is marked with constexpr, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the 
compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.

Automatic storage duration objects
The most common variable types in C++ are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables.[54] The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the reverse order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the stack.

Local variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed RAII, which is widely used in C++.

Member variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an "automatic object" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.

Temporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the ; at the end of a statement).

Reflection 
Mock Object 

Reflection makes a language more suited to network-oriented code. For example, it assists languages such as Java to 
operate well in networks by enabling libraries for serialization, bundling and varying data formats. 
Languages without reflection (e.g. C) have to use auxiliary compilers, e.g. for Abstract Syntax Notation,
 to produce code for serialization and bundling.
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

// Without reflection
Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.hello();

// With reflection
try{
    
    // Alternatively: Object foo = Foo.class.newInstance();
    Object foo = Class.forName("complete.classpath.and.Foo").newInstance();
    
    Method m = foo.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("hello", new Class<?>[0]);
    m.invoke(foo);

}catch(Exception e){

    //Catching ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchMethodException
    //InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException

}

No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).

CPP  history - he motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD. thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.[13] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced C++, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
Point:-Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.[14]
Point:-In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C), adding new features that included virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//).
In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991.[16] New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a boolean type.

After the 2.0 update, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17, and further changes planned for 2020.[17]

Semaphore
wait(Semaphore s){
    while (s==0);    /* wait until s>0 */
    s=s-1;
}
signal(Semaphore s){
    s=s+1;
}

Init(Semaphore s , Int v){
    s=v;
}
Disadvantage
As shown in the examples above, processes waiting on a semaphore must constantly check to see if the semaphore is not zero. This continual looping is clearly a problem in a real multiprogramming system (where often a single CPU is shared among multiple processes). This is called busy waiting and it wastes CPU cycles. When a semaphore does this, it is called a spinlock.
Solution
To avoid busy waiting, a semaphore may use an associated queue of processes that are waiting on the semaphore, allowing the 
semaphore to block the process and then wake it when the semaphore is incremented. The operating system may provide the block() 
system call, which suspends the process that calls it, and the wakeup(P <Process>) system call which resumes the execution of blocked process P.
If a process calls wait() on a semaphore with a value of zero, the process is added to the semaphore’s queue and then blocked. 
The state of the process is switched to the waiting state, and control is transferred to the CPU scheduler, which selects another
process to execute. When another process increments 
the semaphore by calling signal() and there are tasks on the queue, one is taken off of it and resumed
wait(Semaphore s){
    s=s-1;
    if (s<0) {
        // add process to queue
        block();
    }
}

signal(Semaphore s){
    s=s+1;
    if (s<=0) {
        // remove process p from queue
        wakeup(p);
    }
}

Init(Semaphore s , Int v){
    s=v;
}

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), Basic Encoding Rules (BER), and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).
Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard interface description language for defining data structures that can be serialized and deserialized in a cross-platform way. It is broadly used in telecommunications and computer networking, and especially in cryptography.

Quick editing commands
I insert at the begin.
A append to end.
o / O open a new line after/before the current.
v / V / Ctrl+V visual mode (to select text!)
Shift+R replace text
C change remaining part of line.
Combining commands

Most commands accept a amount and direction, for example:

cW = change till end of word
3cW = change 3 words
BcW = to begin of full word, change full word
ciW = change inner word.
ci" = change inner between ".."
ci( = change text between ( .. )
ci< = change text between < .. > (needs set matchpairs+=<:> in vimrc)
4dd = delete 4 lines
3x = delete 3 characters.
3s = substitute 3 characters.
Useful programmer commands

r replace one character (e.g. rd replaces the current char with d).
~ changes case.
J joins two lines
Ctrl+A / Ctrl+X increments/decrements a number.
. repeat last command (a simple macro)
== fix line indent
> indent block (in visual mode)
< unindent block (in visual mode)
Macro recording

Press q[ key ] to start recording.
Then hit q to stop recording.
The macro can be played with @[ key ].

0i:r (to turn the current line into a valid :r command),
"cdd (to delete the line into the "c" register) and
@c execute that command.

0i:r (to turn the current line into a valid :r command),
"cdd (to delete the line into the "c" register) and
@c execute that command.

More powerful is the :r! command. This reads the results of a command. It's the same as suspending the vi session, running a command, 
redirecting its output to a temporary file, resuming your vi session, and reading in the contents from the temp. file.

We can use m to move lines around, and j to join lines

g/re/p (grep) was the way they documented how to "globally" "print" lines containing a "regular expression" 

The :... g and :... v commands bear some explanation as they are incredibly powerful.
 :... g is a prefix for "globally" applying a subsequent command to all lines which match a pattern (regular expression) 
 while :... v applies such a command to all lines which do NOT match the given pattern ("v" from "conVerse"). 

d/foo delete upto foo from current location in forward direction
d?foo delete upto foo from current location in backword direction

lockfs - change or report file system locks
     lockfs is used to change and report the status of file  sys-
     tem  locks.  lockfs  reports the lock status and unlocks the
     file systems that were improperly left locked.

     Using lockfs to lock a file system  is  discouraged  because
     this  requires  extensive knowledge of SunOS internals to be
     used effectively and correctly.
pollsys
select and pselect  
select() and pselect() allow a program to monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become 
"ready" for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible)
