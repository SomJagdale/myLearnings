Hi All, 
Recently I realised I have been working in software developement for an decade, I did lot of mistakes and learned lot of things, So I decided 
to impart my learning lessons what I leared past 10 years, while sharing knowledge I will assure you to share information without any incenties, like sharign partial information or ask to visit on personal website or connect with me one to one. I believe sharing something with you can hugely benifit me also. 

Since this is my 1st post so I have chosen the VI Editor, I am sure people having similler experiance or more than me can resonate this topic.
Vi can seem daunting at first glance. The controls look strange, and the lack of a mouse interface might feel limiting. However, once you get over the initial learning curve, you realize that Vi is far superior for editing configuration files, programs, and other text-based tasks.

I would say if you want to editor which works 
				Its universal availability across Unix-like systems
				with your speed of thought and imagination, 
				Dont want to wast time to touch the mouse
				a sense of concentration and clarity
				compatibility issues on any server

Vi’s controls are based on combining movements and actions, a logic that eventually makes perfect sense.

### Why I Love the Vi Editor: A Decade of Efficiency and Simplicity in Software Development

As a seasoned back-end developer, I’ve had the privilege of working with various text editors and IDEs over the past decade. However, none have come close to matching the simplicity and efficiency offered by the Vi editor. Its universal availability across Unix-like systems ensures I can dive straight into coding without worrying about setup or compatibility issues on any server.

#### The Vi Learning Curve: A Gateway to Productivity

Vi (and its more feature-rich counterpart, Vim) can seem daunting at first glance. The controls look strange, and the lack of a mouse interface might feel limiting. However, once you get over the initial learning curve, you realize that Vi is far superior for editing configuration files, programs, and other text-based tasks.

Vi’s controls are based on combining movements and actions, a logic that eventually makes perfect sense. For instance, scrolling with `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` may seem counterintuitive at first, but it allows you to keep your hands on the keyboard, enhancing your editing speed. This might seem crazy initially, but Vim’s concepts are very well thought-out, making text manipulation commands just a key-press or two away.

#### The Power of Customization and Scripting

One of the most compelling aspects of Vi is its customization potential. Through scripting and personalizing the editor to fit your workflow, you’ll find it hard to understand how you ever managed without it. This capability allows you to become extremely productive when editing text or code.

By integrating Vi with essential tools like cscope, ctags, and Nerd Tree, I've created an environment that meets all my needs without the overhead of larger IDEs. Combining these tools with aliases has made my workflow even faster than my thoughts, ensuring seamless navigation and rapid editing across projects.

#### Vi’s Lightweight and Fast Nature

Vi’s lightweight design means it launches almost instantly, a crucial asset when navigating multiple projects or performing quick edits. This speed and efficiency are unmatched, allowing me to focus on what truly matters—coding.

#### The Aesthetic and Functional Appeal

Vi's classic black command prompt interface evokes a sense of concentration and clarity. It’s more than just a tool; it’s an experience that enhances my productivity and focus. Working within this minimalistic environment eliminates distractions and keeps me deeply immersed in my code.

#### Mastering Vi Commands

Over the years, I’ve honed my skills with powerful Vi commands that expedite navigation and editing tasks. Here are some of my favorites:

- **File Management**:
  - `:e filename` and `:w newfilename` for opening and saving files.
  - `:Explore` for easy file browsing within Vi.
  - `:brows oldfiles`, `:b#`, `:b,`, `:b <Tab>` for managing buffers efficiently.

- **Text Manipulation**:
  - `:g/one\|two/` to list lines containing "one" or "two".
  - `:g/^\s*$/d` to delete all blank lines.
  - `:sav php.html` to save the current file as `php.html`.

- **Navigation and Editing**:
  - `gd`, `gf`, `gh`, `ga`, `g*` for efficient code traversal.
  - `==`, `=%`, `g(start point)==G(end point)` for matching brackets and jumping between lines.
  - `0` to move to column zero, `@` to evaluate commands, `%` to match respective brackets, and `;` to repeat last commands.

- **Search and Replace**:
  - `:%s///gn` for counting matches, and `:%s/pattern//gn` for search pattern counts.
  - `:g/_string/d` to delete lines containing `_string`.

- **Miscellaneous**:
  - `:cd` to change directories in Vi, `~` to change character case, `guw` to change word case, and `guu` and `gUU` to change the case of complete lines.
  - `Ctrl+w,w` to change windows, `dp` to put changes from current window into the other window, and `zo`/`zc` to open/close folded lines.

#### Conclusion

In today’s fast-paced development landscape, Vi remains my editor of choice for its speed, simplicity, and unwavering reliability. Its ability to handle complex tasks with minimal resources and maximal efficiency makes it indispensable for both personal projects and professional endeavors.
