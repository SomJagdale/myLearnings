Please give us some background here. 
1)	Since when have you started seeing this issue? Was it working fine earlier?
2)	Since how long the NTR system is deployed at site? 
3)	What has changed in the system after which this issue is seen? Was there any activity performed which has caused this issue?
4)	Please share your L1 analysis. 
5)	NTR version, label & database used


Feature Considerations :-
1.	Name - GTP based reclaim feature in BRG
2.	Customer Name - TMO
3.	EPIC ID - BRG3-92
4.	NTR - NTR80_PG
5.	Database - Couchbase mainly(Need confirmation for Oracle)
6.	Protocol - GTPv2(GPRS Tunnelling Protocol version 2)
7.	Message  - Diameter Modify-Bearer-Request(MBR)
8.	Content - Cell ID information in User-Location-Information(ULI) AVP
9.	Action - Based on this current Cell ID information in ULI AVP, Cancel Location needs to be sent to such subscribers to trigger network reselection
10.	Impact - reducing revenue loss for T-Mobile
11.	Binary Component - BRG 
12.	BRG Mechanism - CELL ID 
13.	Related feature - Roamer Reclaim 
14.	Deployment - Passive
15.	Tools - IP Probe with MBR Message support 
16.	Pcaps - ULR, IDR, PSI, MBR
