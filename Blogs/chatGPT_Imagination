Hello, LinkedIn leaders and learners.

Consider this blog as a bit of Monday motivation to not to do something. Today, everyone talks about how and where to use ChatGPT or other AI tools in our day to day tasks. However, I would like to offer a different perspective. and share where we should not rely on ChatGPT.

They say imagination is more than just thinking of new ideas. It is a reflection of who we are, shaped by our unique experiences, emotions, and perspectives. When you imagine, you are not just brainstorming solutions you are drawing from the depths of your soul, your memories, and your ambitions.

We should not outsource our imagination to AI tools. For example, you should not ask questions like “Hi ChatGTP, Imagine ideas for my speech topic” or “Suggest me topics to write a LinkedIn blog.” If you rely on AI for this every time, you might feel handicapped when the tool is not around. More importantly, it will hinder your creativity.

You can definitely use tools like ChatGPT for assistance with writing or framing your thoughts, and most importantly, to gather facts based on existing data. Previously, one would have to read a lot of books to learn the facts, but now you can save your valuable time. Honestly, I am a big fan of ChatGPT, and yes, I used it to help frame this blog in some extent.

But here’s where you need to be smart to decide how much you rely on ChatGPT. Today, everyone knows what a ChatGPT-generated message looks like. If you use a message straight from ChatGPT, you will lose the authenticity and originality of your message or idea. So, be careful. In fact, you can be smarter than ChatGPT by telling it to re-frame your message in a way that does not sound like ChatGPT wrote it :).

In an age where technology can do so much, it’s important to remember that the magic of imagination can not be automated. AI tools can assist, but they can not replace the unique perspective you bring to the table. Keep your imagination in your own hands it is the most powerful tool you will ever have.
