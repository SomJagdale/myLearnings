Spotting your own blind spots is harder than spotting others’—because blind spots are the parts of you that feel normal, justified, or invisible.
But they do leave clues if you know where to look.

Here’s a clear, practical way to uncover them 👇

⸻

1. Track your emotional spikes

Strong emotion = blind spot nearby.

Ask yourself:
	•	Why did this bother me so much?
	•	What story am I telling myself right now?

Rule:
Intensity is never about the present moment alone.
It’s reacting to an old pattern.

⸻

2. Listen to repeated feedback you dismiss

Blind spots often arrive as “annoying advice.”

If multiple people say:
	•	“You’re very direct”
	•	“You don’t delegate”
	•	“You overthink / rush”

…and your reaction is:

“They just don’t get me”

👉 That’s a blind spot knocking.

⸻

3. Notice what you defend instantly

Defensiveness is a compass.

Ask:
	•	What am I trying to protect here—my image or the truth?
	•	What would it mean if they were even 10% right?

Blind spots hate curiosity.

⸻

4. Identify your identity armor

These are labels you unconsciously protect:
	•	“I’m logical, not emotional”
	•	“I’m a high performer”
	•	“I’m the responsible one”
	•	“I don’t need help”

Ask:

Who would I be without this label?

Fear in that answer = blind spot.

⸻

5. Watch your recurring conflicts

Patterns repeat until seen.
	•	Same type of disagreement at work
	•	Same frustration with authority / peers
	•	Same feedback in different environments

Different people, same outcome = you’re the constant.

⸻

6. Study your avoidance habits

What you delay is revealing.
	•	Avoid difficult conversations
	•	Avoid asking for help
	•	Avoid slowing down
	•	Avoid visibility

Avoidance often protects an insecurity, not a lack of skill.

⸻

7. Reverse your judgments

Your harsh judgments are mirrors.

If you often think:
	•	“They’re incompetent”
	•	“They’re too emotional”
	•	“They’re political”

Ask:

Where do I fear being seen this way?

⸻

8. Use the 3-question mirror (powerful)

At the end of the day, ask:
	1.	What triggered me today?
	2.	What belief did it activate about me?
	3.	What behavior did it push me into?

Write it. Don’t think it.

⸻

9. Ask for specific, bounded feedback

Open-ended feedback feels threatening.
This works better:

“What’s one thing I do that reduces my impact in meetings?”

or

“Where do you see me getting in my own way?”

The specificity bypasses ego defenses.

⸻

10. The hardest test: Would I trade being right for being effective?

Blind spots survive on righteousness.

Ask:

Do I want to win this moment—or grow long-term?

Growth begins the moment ego loses control.

⸻

The core insight

Your blind spots are not your flaws.
They are your strengths, overused and unexamined.

That’s why high performers (especially leaders and experts) have the most dangerous blind spots.
