Spotting your own blind spots is harder than spotting others’—because blind spots are the parts of you that feel normal, justified, or invisible.
But they do leave clues if you know where to look.

Here’s a clear, practical way to uncover them 👇

⸻

1. Track your emotional spikes

Strong emotion = blind spot nearby.

Ask yourself:
	•	Why did this bother me so much?
	•	What story am I telling myself right now?

Rule:
Intensity is never about the present moment alone.
It’s reacting to an old pattern.

⸻

2. Listen to repeated feedback you dismiss

Blind spots often arrive as “annoying advice.”

If multiple people say:
	•	“You’re very direct”
	•	“You don’t delegate”
	•	“You overthink / rush”

…and your reaction is:

“They just don’t get me”

👉 That’s a blind spot knocking.

⸻

3. Notice what you defend instantly

Defensiveness is a compass.

Ask:
	•	What am I trying to protect here—my image or the truth?
	•	What would it mean if they were even 10% right?

Blind spots hate curiosity.

⸻

4. Identify your identity armor

These are labels you unconsciously protect:
	•	“I’m logical, not emotional”
	•	“I’m a high performer”
	•	“I’m the responsible one”
	•	“I don’t need help”

Ask:

Who would I be without this label?

Fear in that answer = blind spot.

⸻

5. Watch your recurring conflicts

Patterns repeat until seen.
	•	Same type of disagreement at work
	•	Same frustration with authority / peers
	•	Same feedback in different environments

Different people, same outcome = you’re the constant.

⸻

6. Study your avoidance habits

What you delay is revealing.
	•	Avoid difficult conversations
	•	Avoid asking for help
	•	Avoid slowing down
	•	Avoid visibility

Avoidance often protects an insecurity, not a lack of skill.

⸻

7. Reverse your judgments

Your harsh judgments are mirrors.

If you often think:
	•	“They’re incompetent”
	•	“They’re too emotional”
	•	“They’re political”

Ask:

Where do I fear being seen this way?

⸻

8. Use the 3-question mirror (powerful)

At the end of the day, ask:
	1.	What triggered me today?
	2.	What belief did it activate about me?
	3.	What behavior did it push me into?

Write it. Don’t think it.

⸻

9. Ask for specific, bounded feedback

Open-ended feedback feels threatening.
This works better:

“What’s one thing I do that reduces my impact in meetings?”

or

“Where do you see me getting in my own way?”

The specificity bypasses ego defenses.

⸻

10. The hardest test: Would I trade being right for being effective?

Blind spots survive on righteousness.

Ask:

Do I want to win this moment—or grow long-term?

Growth begins the moment ego loses control.

⸻

The core insight

Your blind spots are not your flaws.
They are your strengths, overused and unexamined.

That’s why high performers (especially leaders and experts) have the most dangerous blind spots.

⸻
Absolutely. I’ll walk you through **each point with concrete, real-life examples**, so you can *see* the blind spot in action—not just understand it intellectually.

I’ll use **work + leadership + personal** examples, because that’s where blind spots hurt the most.

---

## 1. Emotional spikes → hidden blind spot

**Situation:**
In a review meeting, someone says:

> “Your solution is good, but it’s a bit overengineered.”

**Your reaction (inside):**

* Sudden irritation
* You start justifying every design decision
* The rest of the feedback doesn’t register

**Blind spot:**
You equate *complexity with competence*.

**Deeper belief:**

> “If it’s simple, maybe I’m not valuable.”

**Resulting behavior:**
You defend instead of listening.

---

## 2. Repeated feedback you dismiss

**Situation:**
Three different people tell you over time:

> “You’re very intense in discussions.”

**Your response:**

* “That’s just how professionals talk.”
* “People are too sensitive.”

**Blind spot:**
Your clarity feels like pressure to others.

**Deeper belief:**

> “If I soften, I’ll lose authority.”

**Impact:**
People hesitate to challenge you, reducing real collaboration.

---

## 3. Instant defensiveness

**Situation:**
Your manager says:

> “You could delegate this part.”

**Your immediate reply:**

* “It’s faster if I do it.”
* “Others won’t do it right.”

**Blind spot:**
You don’t trust outcomes you don’t control.

**Deeper belief:**

> “My value comes from execution, not enablement.”

**Cost:**
You become a bottleneck—and invisible as a leader.

---

## 4. Identity armor

**Identity statement:**

> “I’m logical, not emotional.”

**Scenario:**
A team member raises morale or burnout concerns.

**Your internal reaction:**

* “We should focus on facts, not feelings.”

**Blind spot:**
You see emotions as noise, not data.

**Deeper fear:**

> “If I engage emotionally, I might lose control.”

**Impact:**
People feel unheard, even when you solve the technical problem.

---

## 5. Recurring conflicts

**Pattern:**

* Conflicts with managers who are less technical
* Frustration with “political” stakeholders

**Your narrative:**

> “They don’t understand real work.”

**Blind spot:**
You undervalue influence relative to expertise.

**Hidden assumption:**

> “Competence should speak for itself.”

**Reality:**
Visibility and alignment decide impact, not just correctness.

---

## 6. Avoidance habits

**Situation:**
You delay:

* Asking for promotion
* Publicly showcasing your work
* Giving upward feedback

**Rationalization:**

* “Let results speak.”
* “It’s not the right time.”

**Blind spot:**
You associate visibility with ego or risk.

**Deeper belief:**

> “If I push myself forward, I’ll be judged.”

**Outcome:**
Others with less impact get noticed first.

---

## 7. Harsh judgments (projection)

**Your thought:**

> “That person talks a lot but delivers little.”

**Reality check:**
You actually fear:

* Being seen as all talk
* Being questioned on depth

**Blind spot:**
You suppress communication to avoid exposure.

**Effect:**
Your ideas stay under-leveraged.

---

## 8. The 3-question mirror (daily example)

**Event:**
A junior questions your design in a meeting.

1. **Trigger:** Being questioned publicly
2. **Belief activated:** “If I’m questioned, I lose authority”
3. **Behavior:** You shut the discussion down quickly

**Blind spot:**
Authority ≠ unquestioned control
Authority = calm openness.

---

## 9. Specific feedback example

**Instead of:**

> “Any feedback for me?”

**You ask:**

> “What’s one thing I do in meetings that reduces my impact?”

**Response you get:**

> “You answer too quickly; people stop thinking.”

**Blind spot:**
Speed feels like leadership to you.
Others experience it as dominance.

---

## 10. Right vs effective

**Situation:**
You’re technically correct in an argument.

**Choice A (right):**
Prove it thoroughly.

**Choice B (effective):**
Pause, ask, align.

**Blind spot:**
You equate being right with being respected.

**Long-term truth:**
People follow those who make them feel *included*, not corrected.

---

## Big unifying pattern (important)

> **Blind spots are usually your greatest strengths pushed too far.**

| Strength       | Overused → Blind Spot |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| High standards | Perceived rigidity    |
| Speed          | Perceived impatience  |
| Logic          | Emotional disconnect  |
| Independence   | Lack of trust         |
| Competence     | Control issues        |

---

## One powerful self-test (use this weekly)

Ask:

> “Where is my strength becoming expensive for others?”

That single question reveals blind spots faster than any personality test.
