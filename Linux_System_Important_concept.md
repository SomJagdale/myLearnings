**key Linux system programming concepts** 

like Lazy Initialization and High Water Mark effect

---

## **1. Copy-on-Write (CoW)**
- **What:** When a resource (e.g., memory page, file) is cloned, both copies share the same data until one is modified—then a separate copy is made.
- **Where:** `fork()`, file systems (like Btrfs, ZFS), memory management.
- **Why:** Efficient resource usage, faster process creation.

---

## **2. Page Faults**
- **What:** Occurs when a process accesses memory that is not currently mapped to physical RAM; the OS must handle and resolve it.
- **Where:** Memory access after lazy allocation, swapping.
- **Why:** Impacts performance, understanding needed for debugging memory issues.

---

## **3. Demand Paging**
- **What:** Only loads memory pages into RAM when they are accessed—not all at once.
- **Where:** Executable loading, large arrays, mmap.
- **Why:** Saves memory, improves startup times.

---

## **4. Memory Mapping (`mmap`)**
- **What:** Maps files or devices into process memory space.
- **Where:** Large file I/O, shared memory, inter-process communication.
- **Why:** Efficient file access, enables shared memory.

---

## **5. Kernel vs User Space**
- **What:** Separation between OS kernel (privileged operations) and user programs (restricted access).
- **Where:** System calls, process isolation.
- **Why:** Security, stability.

---

## **6. Signals and Interrupts**
- **What:** Asynchronous notifications/events sent to a process or handled by the kernel.
- **Where:** Termination (`SIGTERM`), segmentation fault (`SIGSEGV`), timers.
- **Why:** Handling errors, async events, resource cleanup.

---

## **7. File Descriptors and Resource Limits**
- **What:** Integer handles for files/sockets; limits set by OS (ulimit).
- **Where:** Every I/O operation, process limits.
- **Why:** Avoid resource exhaustion, understand system constraints.

---

## **8. Process Scheduling and Context Switching**
- **What:** How the kernel divides CPU time among processes; switching between them saves/restores state.
- **Where:** Multitasking, threads.
- **Why:** Performance tuning, real-time systems.

---

## **9. Swapping and Out-of-Memory (OOM) Killer**
- **What:** OS can move inactive pages to disk ("swap"); if memory is exhausted, OOM killer terminates processes.
- **Where:** High memory pressure, servers.
- **Why:** Prevent system crashes, understand Linux memory behavior.

---

## **10. Memory Leaks and Fragmentation**
- **What:** Allocated memory that is never freed; fragmentation reduces usable memory.
- **Where:** Long-running servers, low-level C/C++.
- **Why:** Stability, efficient resource usage.

---

## **11. Shared Libraries and Dynamic Linking**
- **What:** Code loaded at run time rather than compile time.
- **Where:** `/lib`, `ldd`, `dlopen`.
- **Why:** Smaller binaries, easier updates.

---

## **12. Cgroups and Namespaces**
- **What:** Kernel features for resource isolation and limiting (CPU, memory, etc); namespaces isolate process views.
- **Where:** Containers (Docker), multi-tenant systems.
- **Why:** Security, scalability.

---

## **13. Locking, Race Conditions, and Deadlocks**
- **What:** Mechanisms to synchronize access to resources; bugs when not handled correctly.
- **Where:** Multithreaded apps, shared resources.
- **Why:** Correctness, reliability.

---

## **14. Kernel Slab Allocator and Buddy System**
- **What:** Kernel memory allocation strategies for efficiency and fragmentation reduction.
- **Where:** Internal kernel memory management.
- **Why:** Understanding kernel internals, debugging.

---

## **15. Ephemeral vs Persistent Storage**
- **What:** Data that lives only during session/process vs data stored long-term.
- **Where:** `/tmp`, `/var`, SSD/HDD.
- **Why:** Data durability, crash recovery.

---

### **Why These Matter**
- They help in debugging and optimizing Linux systems and applications.
- Essential for understanding system-level performance, reliability, and resource usage.
- Useful for writing portable, robust, and secure system software.
