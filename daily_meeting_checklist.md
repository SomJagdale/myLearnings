# Somnath’s Daily Mental Checklist

*(Before Meetings, Decisions, or Difficult Conversations)*

## 1️⃣ Ground Yourself (10 seconds)

**Ask:**

* Am I calm, or am I reacting?
* What emotion might I be carrying into this?

👉 *Rule:* Never decide when emotionally hijacked.

---

## 2️⃣ Clarify the Purpose (Why now?)

**Ask:**

* What is the **one outcome** that makes this meeting successful?
* Is this for **alignment, decision, influence, or information**?

👉 If unclear → **pause or redefine** the meeting.

---

## 3️⃣ Identify the Situation Type

Quickly classify:

* Explaining something → *What–Why–How*
* Decision under uncertainty → *OODA*
* Coaching / mentoring → *GROW*
* Negotiation → *Principled Negotiation*
* Conflict → *IEO*
* Problem solving → *Problem → Options → Criteria*
* Story / influence → *Story arc*

👉 *Wrong framework = wrong outcome.*

---

## 4️⃣ Audience & Power Awareness

**Ask:**

* Who is in the room?
* Who influences the outcome?
* What do they **care about most** (fear / goal)?

👉 Speak to **interests**, not titles.

---

## 5️⃣ Define Success & Trade-offs

**Ask:**

* What does “good enough” look like?
* What am I **willing to trade** (time, scope, ego)?

👉 Leaders choose trade-offs consciously.

---

## 6️⃣ Prepare Your Core Message

**Limit to 3 bullets max:**

* One key insight
* One supporting reason
* One example or data point

👉 If it can’t fit in 3 bullets, it’s not clear yet.

---

## 7️⃣ Decide Your Stance (Firm or Flexible?)

**Ask:**

* Is my position **non-negotiable**?
* Where can I be flexible?

👉 This avoids on-the-spot confusion.

---

## 8️⃣ Anticipate Resistance

**Ask:**

* What objection is most likely?
* What emotion might show up?

👉 Prepare **one calm response**, not many arguments.

---

## 9️⃣ Choose Your Mode (Especially for Conflict)

Quick pick:

* Avoid
* Accommodate
* Compete
* Compromise
* Collaborate

👉 Mode is a **choice**, not a reflex.

---

## 🔟 End With Learning (Post-meeting reminder)

Promise yourself:

* What will I learn even if this goes wrong?

👉 This keeps ego out and growth in.

---
