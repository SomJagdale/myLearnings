**CTO of a technology company within the next five years**, your coaching questions should focus on **vision, skills, strategic positioning, networking, and execution**. Here’s a structured coaching approach using the **GROW model** with tailored questions:  

---

### **1. Clarifying the Goal (G – Goal / O – Outcome)**  
- Why do you want to become a **CTO**? What excites you about this role?  
- What kind of **technology company** are you aiming for? (Startup, mid-size, enterprise, industry-specific?)  
- What specific **skills and leadership qualities** do you believe a CTO must have?  
- How will you measure your success in reaching this goal?  
- What **timeline milestones** will you set for yourself in the next five years?

### **2. Understanding Their Current Position (R – Reality / S – Situation)**  
- What is your **current role**, and how does it align with the CTO path?  
- What **technical and strategic leadership** experience do you already have?  
- How much exposure do you have to **business strategy and decision-making**?  
- Have you led **cross-functional teams** or worked closely with product & business teams?  
- What feedback have you received from senior leadership about your potential?  
- How well do you **understand emerging technologies** and industry trends?  
- What’s missing in your **executive presence, communication, or influence**?

### **3. Exploring Growth Strategies (O – Options / C – Choices)**  
- What are the **key skills** you need to develop to be CTO-ready? (Tech strategy, scaling teams, budgeting, innovation, etc.)  
- Would **mentorship from a current CTO** help in your journey?  
- Should you take on **more strategic projects** to gain leadership visibility?  
- How can you improve your **business acumen** (e.g., MBA, executive leadership programs, working closely with business teams)?  
- Have you considered **public speaking, blogging, or networking** to establish thought leadership?  
- Would **transitioning to a more strategic role** (Head of Engineering, VP of Tech) accelerate your path?  
- Should you **join a startup or co-found a company** instead of climbing the corporate ladder?

### **4. Defining Actionable Steps (W – Will / A – Actions / Way Forward)**  
- What **three immediate steps** will you take in the next three months?  
- Who in your network can **mentor or sponsor** you for leadership opportunities?  
- How will you gain **experience in managing larger teams and budgets**?  
- What technical areas do you need to **stay updated on** (AI, cloud, cybersecurity, blockchain, etc.)?  
- How will you **track your progress** over the next five years?  
- What **personal mindset shift** do you need to make this transition happen?  

---

### **5. Reviewing & Refining the Plan (R – Review / S – Sustainability)**  
- How often will you **assess and adjust** your progress? (Every 6 months?)  
- What challenges do you anticipate, and how will you overcome them?  
- How will you build your **executive presence and brand**?  
- If things don’t go as planned, what is your **backup strategy**?
