**efficient reading comprehension and retention**.  

### **PQ4R Framework**  
1. **Preview** â€“ Skim through headings, subheadings, and summaries to get an overview.  
2. **Question** â€“ Ask what you expect to learn and what key ideas might be.  
3. **Read** â€“ Actively read with the questions in mind.  
4. **Reflect** â€“ Summarize key points in your own words.  
5. **Recite** â€“ Recall key concepts aloud or write them down.  
6. **Review** â€“ Quickly revisit after a few hours/days to reinforce learning.  

Alternatively, if you need **speed + retention**, try the **Feynman Technique**:  
1. Read the material.  
2. Explain it in simple terms as if teaching a child.  
3. Identify gaps in understanding and re-read.  
4. Simplify further until you grasp it fully.
