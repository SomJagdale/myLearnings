PQ4R Framework
Preview – Skim through headings, subheadings, and summaries to get an overview.
Question – Ask what you expect to learn and what key ideas might be.
Read – Actively read with the questions in mind.
Reflect – Summarize key points in your own words.
Recite – Recall key concepts aloud or write them down.
Review – Quickly revisit after a few hours/days to reinforce learning.
Alternatively, if you need speed + retention, try the Feynman Technique:

Read the material.
Explain it in simple terms as if teaching a child.
Identify gaps in understanding and re-read.
Simplify further until you grasp it fully.
