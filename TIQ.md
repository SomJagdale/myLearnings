C++ 11

### Core Language Runtime Performance Enhancements

1.  Can you explain how rvalue references and move constructors improve performance in C++11? Could you provide a practical example where using move semantics significantly reduces overhead, particularly in the context of a class that manages a resource?

2. How does the `constexpr` keyword change the way we can use constants in C++11? Can you demonstrate an example where using `constexpr` enables compile-time evaluation of a function that wouldn't be possible in earlier versions of C++?

### Core Language Build-time Performance Enhancements

3.  What is the purpose of the `extern` template declaration in C++11, and how does it affect build times in large projects? Can you provide a scenario where using `extern` templates would lead to a more efficient compilation process?

### Core Language Usability Enhancements

4.  How do initializer lists improve the usability of constructors in C++11? Can you show an example where initializer lists make the initialization of complex data structures more intuitive and concise compared to traditional methods?

5.  How does the range-based for loop simplify iterating over containers in C++11? Can you illustrate its advantages over traditional for loops with a code example, particularly focusing on readability and reduced chances of errors?

6.  Can you explain the role of lambda functions in C++11 and how they enhance functional programming capabilities? Provide an example where a lambda function effectively replaces a more verbose function object in a standard algorithm.

7.  What are the enhancements related to object construction in C++11? Can you explain how these improvements can lead to better performance in the context of creating and initializing large objects?

8.  How do the `override` and `final` specifiers enhance code safety and clarity in C++11? Can you provide an example demonstrating how these features prevent common pitfalls in inheritance hierarchies?

9.  How does the introduction of `nullptr` in C++11 improve type safety compared to using `NULL`? Can you also discuss how the `auto` keyword can simplify type declarations, especially in complex scenarios?

10.  Can you explain the significance of the right angle bracket (`>>`) in nested template declarations in C++11? Why was this change necessary, and how does it improve code readability?

11. What is the purpose of explicit conversion operators in C++11, and how do they differ from implicit conversion? Can you provide an example where using an explicit conversion operator prevents unintended conversions?

12.  How do template aliases in C++11 improve code clarity and maintainability? Can you provide an example where using a template alias simplifies the use of complex template types?

### Core Language Functionality Improvements

13.  Why was the `long long int` type introduced in C++11, and how does it address limitations in previous standards? Can you demonstrate its usage with an example that highlights its benefits in handling large integer values?

14.  How do static assertions in C++11 help enforce compile-time conditions? Can you give an example of a situation where using `static_assert` can prevent errors before the code is run?

15. How does allowing `sizeof` to work on class members without an explicit object improve usability? Can you illustrate this feature with an example comparing its use in C++11 to previous versions?

16.  What does the allowance for garbage collected implementations in C++11 entail, and how does it impact memory management? Can you discuss potential trade-offs when using garbage collection compared to manual memory management?

### C++ Standard Library Changes

17.  What are some of the key upgrades to standard library components in C++11? Can you explain how these changes enhance usability or performance, particularly focusing on a specific component?

18.  How did C++11 introduce threading facilities, and why is this significant for modern software development? Can you provide an example demonstrating the creation and management of threads using the C++11 threading library?

19.  What are tuple types in C++11, and how do they differ from traditional structures? Can you give an example of a situation where using a `std::tuple` is advantageous?

20.  How do hash tables, introduced in C++11, enhance data structure options? Can you explain the use cases where `std::unordered_map` would be preferred over `std::map`?

21.  Can you explain the advantages of `std::array` and `std::forward_list` over traditional arrays and linked lists? In which scenarios would you choose one over the other?

22.  How do regular expressions in C++11 enhance string processing capabilities? Can you provide an example demonstrating how to use `std::regex` to perform pattern matching on strings?

23.  How do general-purpose smart pointers (like `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`) improve memory management in C++11? Can you discuss a scenario where using a smart pointer prevents memory leaks?
