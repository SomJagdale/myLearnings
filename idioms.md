walking on the air

ahead of the game

piece of cake 

better late than never

blessing in disguse 

a dime a dozen 

beat around the bush 

bit a bullet

break a leg 

call it day 

cutting corners 

get out of hand 

get your act together

give some one benifit of doubt 

hang in there

hit the sack 

its not a rocket sicence 

make long story short 

miss the boat 

no pain no gain 

on the ball 

pull someone's leg

pull yourself together

so far so good

speak of the devil 

thats the last straw

the best of both worlds

time flies when you are having fun 

to make matters worse

under the wheather br

we will cross that bridge we we come to it 

wrap you head around 

you can say that again 

your guess is as good as mine 

penny saved is penny earned 

a perfect storm 

picture is worth 1000 words

action speaks louder than words

add insult to injury 

barking up wrong tree

birds of feather flock together

break the ice 

comparing apples and oranges

costs an arm and leg

do something at the drop of hat 

dont give up your day job

dont put all your eggs in one basket 

every cloud has a silver lining

get the taste of your own medicine 

give someone cold shoulder 

good things come to those who wait

he has a bigger fish to fry 

ignorence is bliss 

its raining cat and dogs

kill two birds in one stone 

lte the cat out of the bag 

live and leran 

look before you leap 

on thin ice

once in blue moon 

Play devil's advocate 

put something on ice 

rain on someone's parade 

saving for rainy day 

slow and steady win the race 

spoils the beans 

the ball is in your court 

the best thing since sliced bread 

the early birds gets the worm

the elephant in the room 

the whole nine yard 

there are other fish in the sea 

there is method to his madness 

there is no such thing as a free lunch 

through caution to the wind 

you cant have your cake and eat it too 

you cant judge a book by its cover 

a littler learning is dangerous thing 

a snowball effect 

a right as rain 

burn bridges 

curiosity kills the cat 

cut the mustard 

dont beat a dead hourse 

every dog has a day 

familirity breeds contempt 

fit as a fiddle 

hear something straingh from horse's mouth 

he is not playing with full deck 

he is sitting on fence 

know which way the wind is blowing 

leave no stone unturned 

let slipping dog lie 

like riding a bicycle 

like to peas in pod 

on cloud nine 

run like wind 

shape up or ship out 

that ship has sailed 

there are clouds on horizone 

time is money 

well begun is half done 

when it rains it pours 

you cant make omlet without braking some eggs
