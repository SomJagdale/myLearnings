Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express **modality** â€“ likelihood, ability, permission, obligation, necessity, etc. They are quite sensitive to context. Here are some frequently used modal verbs and how their meaning shifts:

**1. Can:**

* **Ability:** "I *can* swim." (I have the physical skill.)
* **Possibility:** "It *can* get very cold here in winter." (It is possible for this to happen.)
* **Permission (informal):** "*Can* I borrow your pen?" (Is it okay if I borrow your pen?)
* **Offer (informal):** "I *can* help you with that." (I am willing to assist.)

**2. Could:**

* **Past Ability:** "When I was younger, I *could* run very fast." (I had the ability then.)
* **Polite Request:** "*Could* you please close the door?" (A more formal and polite request than "Can you...?")
* **Possibility (less certain than "can"):** "It *could* rain tomorrow." (There is a chance of rain.)
* **Conditional:** "If I had more time, I *could* travel the world." (Hypothetical possibility.)
* **Suggestion (polite):** "We *could* try that new restaurant." (A gentle suggestion.)

**3. May:**

* **Possibility (more formal than "might"):** "It *may* snow tonight." (There is a chance of snow.)
* **Permission (formal):** "*May* I enter?" (Is it permissible for me to enter?)
* **Wish (formal):** "*May* you have a long and happy life." (Expressing a hope.)

**4. Might:**

* **Possibility (less likely than "may"):** "I *might* go to the party, but I'm not sure." (A smaller chance.)
* **Polite Suggestion (less direct than "could"):** "You *might* want to consider this option." (A gentle suggestion.)
* **Past Possibility (often with "have"):** "He *might have* missed the bus." (A possibility in the past.)

**5. Will:**

* **Future Tense (prediction):** "I *will* go to the store later." (A statement about the future.)
* **Volition/Intention:** "I *will* help you, I promise." (Expressing a strong intention.)
* **Request (less polite/more direct):** "*Will* you please be quiet?" (Can sound demanding depending on tone.)
* **Habitual Action (in the past):** "He *would* always complain about the weather." (Describing a past habit.)

**6. Would:**

* **Conditional:** "If I had the money, I *would* buy a new car." (Hypothetical situation.)
* **Polite Request:** "*Would* you mind helping me?" (A very polite request.)

* **Future in the Past (reported speech):** "He said he *would* be late." (What he said about his future.)
* **Preference:** "I *would* prefer coffee to tea." (Expressing a choice.)

**7. Shall:**

* **Advice/Suggestion:** "You *should* try the cake." (A recommendation.)
* **Expectation/Likelihood:** "They *should* be here by now." (It is likely.)
* **Conditional (less common than "would"):** "If it rains, we *should* stay inside." (A likely consequence.)

**9. Must:**

* **Strong Obligation/Necessity:** "You *must* wear a seatbelt." (It is required.)
* **Strong Deduction/Certainty:** "He *must* be very tired; he hasn't slept in days." (A logical conclusion.)
* **Prohibition (with "not"):** "You *must not* smoke here." (It is forbidden.)

**Key to Understanding the Meaning:**

As you pointed out with "could," the key to understanding the meaning of a modal verb lies heavily in the **context** of the sentence and the surrounding words. Consider:

* **The verb it modifies:** The action being described influences the modality.
* **The subject of the sentence:** Who is performing the action can provide clues.
* **The presence of other contextual clues:** Time expressions, conditional clauses, the tone of the statement (question, command, suggestion).
* **Social context:** The formality of the situation often influences the choice and interpretation of modal verbs (e.g., "may" is more formal for permission than "can").
