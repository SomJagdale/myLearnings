will check ula for every message, even though we are receiving message from the same network, since we are not keeping network to ambr received or not, or any last amber check timer.
once fallback from 5gnsa to next tech, timer will start.

fallback when ambr not received and only one network is available 

CLogger::Debug(__FILE__, __LINE__, "[%s][%.f][%s] NTR has decided to steer this subscriber with ALL type cos[%d] even if override is present", event->baseEventPtr->roamerInfo.imsi, event->txnID, CTRUtils::GetMesgDescription(event->mesgType), event->baseEventPtr->appliedData.appliedCoSID);
CLogger::Debug(__FILE__, __LINE__, "[%s][%.f][%s] User has provided override for prioritized tech only, 2nd prioritized will consider All type cos[%d] even if override is present", event->baseEventPtr->roamerInfo.imsi, event->txnID, CTRUtils::GetMesgDescription(event->mesgType), event->baseEventPtr->appliedData.appliedCoSID);

1. When NTR dont find the device entry(TAC) in database which tell subscriber handset support/not support for 5g tech, NTR assumes it suppors.

2. In 5GNSA Steering when NTR dont find the AMBR in ULA, still NTR is trying for another network and hopping for AMBR might present, but my understanding 
AMBR is associated with subscription data and not dependent of Network, so can we initiate the email to kumar about this?

4. Not all traces in NTR binary are with tokens 117.

5. Static CoS Priority is not implemented for the oracle, Same with GUI.

6. SAR is not merged in NTR90.

7. If they provide the override user has to provide two override instead of one.

Before taking issue for sprint make sure below points
1. Is this issue got replicated?
2. Do we have enough data from the site to take this in a sprint
3. We will request all necessory data from site within initial 7 days.
4. If we dont get any one from 1st and 2nd point we should make this a red
5. Developer should udpate the RAG status
6. If you give more work to TL, he will be a team member not a tech lead. He will not get bandwidh to help other team members and QE.
7. more time for documentations and jira items
8.

Actvites to work on bugs
	Going throguth JIRA details, 
	Going through Email chain
	Going roamertrace, NTR.log 
	Understanding the source code
	Getting setup ready for replicate including same tag and databse 
	Replicating the issue 
	Finding out the route cause 
	Fixing the bug 
	Check-in fix in different branches 

Analysis based on below logs 
Request necessory setup details, including NTR Version, RTag, and Database in use etc. OR you can ask them to run the following commands to collect essential setup detail
                networktr -v
      cat /etc/os-release
      file networktr
      ldd networktr(if required)
Check if there have been recent updates or changes to labels or configurations on the site that might triggered the issue.
Ask if user have made configuration changes or if there have been major system activities just before the issue was observed.
Inquire about how frequently the issue is happening. Is it a recurring problem, or is it in-consistent?
Check if the issue is specific to particular IMSIs, networks, zones, or nodes.
Determine if the issue occurs during high or low traffic loads.
Request relevant logs, including Roametrace, NTR, Trap, and KPI logs.
Ask for configuration details, such as TR.cfg, fsmpapp.properties, system parameters, network settings, and cos details. These can get from site's cache dumps.
For more information you can request pcaps, rwmonitors, ptrace, and core dumps (for C++ applications).
As per me best way to resolve the issue is to replicate it in a dev env. Try to recreate the same scenario case that triggered the issue on the site.
While replicating issue try to match dev setup to site setup.
If possible check the traces traffic source entities like DRA, IPProbe and SSTP
Check whether the issue has a functionality impact or any revenue leakage.

The new operator can be overloaded, whereas the malloc function cannot.
If there is not enough memory, the new operator throws an exception, whereas the malloc function returns null.
The return type of the new operator is of the same type for which the memory was allocated. We don't need to do typecasting.
The new operator automatically computes the size of the data object. We don't need to use the sizeof() operator.
The new operator allows us to initialize objects while creating memory space for them.

In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java heap is divided into several memory pools, each serving a specific purpose. 
The different pools are:

Young Generation: This is where objects are created and stored initially. The young generation is further divided into two memory pools, 
the eden space and the survivor spaces (S0 and S1).

Old Generation: This is where objects are moved after they have survived a certain number of garbage collections in the young generation. 
The old generation is also known as the tenured generation.

Permanent Generation: This is where class metadata and static variables are stored.

Metaspace: This is where the JVM stores class metadata, starting from Java 8. In previous versions of Java, the permanent generation was 
used for this purpose.

Each memory pool has its own garbage collector, responsible for managing the memory in that pool. The choice of which memory pool to use 
for storing an object depends on the object's size and age. Understanding the different memory pools and their roles is important for 
tuning the JVM and avoiding memory-related issues such as OutOfMemoryErrors.

what is eden space and the survivor spaces in java jvm
In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the eden space and the survivor spaces are part of the young generation memory pool. The young generation is where newly created objects are initially stored.

Eden Space: The eden space is the main memory pool in the young generation, where most objects are initially stored. When the eden space becomes full, a minor garbage collection is triggered to reclaim memory by removing objects that are no longer being used.

Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1): The survivor spaces are smaller memory pools in the young generation where objects that have survived a minor garbage collection are moved. If an object survives a few minor garbage collections, it is eventually moved to the old generation. The survivor spaces are used to help minimize the number of objects that need to be moved to the old generation, thus reducing the amount of time spent in full garbage collections.

In summary, the eden space is used for storing most new objects, while the survivor spaces are used for storing objects that have survived a few minor garbage collections. The use of the eden space and the survivor spaces helps minimize the time spent in full garbage collections, which can improve the overall performance of the JVM.


This is a log generated by the jstat command line tool in Java, which provides information about the performance statistics of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The log provides data on various memory pools and garbage collection statistics of the JVM.

Four principles of technical communication: 
1. Start at the right point (From Known to Unknown) - "show of hands" - err on the side of caution
2. Don't go too far into the rabbit hole - explain 3 things that pique interest rather than a whole load of information
3. Clarity is better than Accuracy - iron out the finer details later
4. Explain why it is "cool" - enthusiasm is key 

Most importantly, convey "It is not about whether you are good or bad at it, it is all about being interested in it!"

C++ is a widely-used programming language that has been around for several decades. It is known for its flexibility, performance, and ability to be used in a wide range of applications, from low-level systems programming to high-performance computing, games, and more.

As for the future of C++, it is considered to be a stable and mature language with a large and active community of developers. The C++ language is still being actively developed and improved through the C++ Standards Committee (also known as ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21) and the C++ community.

C++20, the latest version of C++, which was released in 2020, included several new features and improvements such as modules, coroutines, and concepts. C++23 is in the works and will bring more features and improvements.

C++ is widely used in industries such as gaming, finance, and simulation, and it is also used in developing operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance computing. It is expected to continue to be a popular choice for these types of applications in the future.

Additionally, the recent years have seen an increase in the use of C++ for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, this trend is likely to continue in the future.

Overall, C++ is a powerful, versatile and efficient language that will continue to be widely used in various fields, and the future looks bright for the language.

The easiest way to explain it would be to think of a battery. Nature is about balance. You know that when you put the positive side of a magnet close to the negative side of another magnet, they're going to try to pull together. They're trying to "balance" themselves.
Now think about that with electrons. The electrons in the negative side of the battery really REALLY want to get to the positive side. We take advantage of this by creating circuits. We give them a path to get to that positive side that they desperately want to reach, and we have them do a little work for us along the way. The MORE free electrons in the negative side of the battery, the more POTENTIAL there is for us to use (Voltage).
This is why a fully charged battery will read its rated voltage, or close to it, and why a depleted battery will read a noticeably LOWER voltage -- reflecting the fact that many of those electrons are now at the positive side of the battery. There aren't AS MANY of them left that need to get over there anymore, so much of the FORCE they provide when traveling through the circuit has dissipated.

	Kernel taint - In the context of operating systems, "kernel taint" refers to a state in which the integrity of the kernel (the core of the operating system that manages communication between hardware and software) has been compromised. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as the presence of a bug or security vulnerability, or the use of a device or module that is not compatible with the kernel.

jetty vs netty
This is crude simplification, but it allows to understand the difference easily:

Netty is a framework to write TCP and UDP applications.

Jetty is a framework to write HTTP applications.

https://www.quora.com/Where-are-virtual-tables-stored-in-C

Some things to note:

the “vtable for S” and the global variable s are defined similarly, which is as expected since they’re both global variables
unlike the global variable s, the “vtable for S” is in a special “.rodata” section where “rodata” means “read-only data”
unlike the global variable s, the “vtable for S” is declared .weak which means that this definition can appear “in duplicate” in other object files; that ensures that having similar code in other translation units won’t cause linker errors
the size of the global variable s is 8, which is the space needed to hold a pointer to the “vtable for S”
the “vtable for S” points not only to the virtual functions of S (S::f in this case), but also to another implicit global variable known as “typeinfo for S” (that address is, e.g., produced by the expression typeid(S))
the line “.quad 0” in the definition for “vtable for S” is used to implement dynamic_cast<void*>, which returns a pointer to “the most-derived object”; the value 0 is the offset from the pointer to the virtual table to the beginning of the most derived object — you’d need a case involving multiple inheritance to make it non-zero in this ABI


As other answers point out, it’s for maximum efficiency.

Pro-tip : every C compiler I’ve ever come across will initialize pointers to NULL in debug mode.

So if your release build blows up but your debug build doesn’t, it’s not a quantum thing where the bug disappears through the act of observing it. It’s a reference to an uninitialized pointer.

Ten thoughts for who is starting their C++ journey:

1. Move semantics is not mandatory - it is optional; You don't even need to be aware of move semantics to use all the potential of the C++ language and unleash all power of modern optimizing compilers

2. Move semantics was created to deal with a niche case of very large objects (matrices and images) in the 2000s and was generalized to everything by skilled propaganda; small objects do not benefit from move semantics

3. Move semantics is an all-in or all-out issue - you have to pick a side before you start writing code; you cannot use it half-way.

4. However if you use it once, you need to MASTER everything: prvalue, xvalue, glvalue, && and variants, std::move, std::forward, perfect forwarding etc

5. Learning move semantics half way is a recipe for disaster as evidence mounts for its dangerous misuse which often backfires dramatically.

6. Move semantics will introduce a lot of unnecessary complexity and boilerplate into your code (rule of 5); weight the tradeoff vis-a-vis maintenance by more junior members of the team; for managers this means your hiring pool will be shrunk by half or more

7. You definitely do not need move semantics to write ultra low latency code. In fact you might be better off without it, there are alternative techniques that are simpler, faster and better

8. In fact, most performance applications I know (mostly gaming and trading ) sidestep move semantics altogether

9. Shared pointers, and intrusive ones in particular, render move semantics unnecessary

10. unique_ptr asks for move semantics; shared_ptr avoids it

Pick the red or the blue pill.

A vtable is created when a class declaration contains a virtual function. A vtable is introduced when a parent -- anywhere in the heirarchy -- has a virtual function, lets call this parent Y. Any parent of Y WILL NOT have a vtable

curl
curl --upload-file <FILE NAME> https://uploads.couchbase.com/mobileum/38906/ 
Linux curl command is used to download or upload data to a server via supported protocols such as HTTP, FTP, IMAP, SFTP, TFTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, etc. 
It is a remote utility, so it works without user interaction. The data transfer from one place to another is one of the vital and most used tasks of 
a computer system.

If your goal is to convince the person you're arguing against, then you have to be much more careful about it.
 The key is this: NEVER try to make them admit that they're wrong.
 If you do, then sheer pride will keep them from agreeing with you, even in the face of all logic.
 My favorite approach is to find something in their argument I agree with, even if you're just agreeing that the earth is round. 
 Acknowledge their points and their rightness. Then frame your arguments as just a modification on the points they're making, and 
 argue for your side, presenting it as a compromise between your points of view.

Overloaded "&&" and "||" operators lose their short-circuit evaluation property.

the process of reorganizing common behavior from non-abstract classes into "abstract classes" using inheritance to abstract over sub-classes
 as seen in the object-oriented C++ and Java programming languages.

Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. 
 It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running
Template metaprogramming (TMP) is a metaprogramming technique in which templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code, 
 which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled. 

How Strong type checking implemented in c++? :D
In 1979, Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, 
 including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.
In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C), adding new features that included virtual functions,
 function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type 
 checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes
In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991.[16] New features in 2.0 
 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. 
In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions 
included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a boolean type.


Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles:[13]

It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs.
Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).
Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++.
Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++.
It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.
No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).
User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types.
Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance).
There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language).
C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment.
If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.

2.1	Object storage
2.1.1	Static storage duration objects
2.1.2	Thread storage duration objects
2.1.3	Automatic storage duration objects
2.1.4	Dynamic storage duration objects

Static storage duration objects are initialized in two phases. First, "static initialization" is performed, and only after all static 
initialization is performed, "dynamic initialization" is performed. In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros;
 after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized
 with a literal or constexpr). 
Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data 
partition of the executable. Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless 
the function is marked with constexpr, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the 
compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.

Automatic storage duration objects
The most common variable types in C++ are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables.[54] The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the reverse order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the stack.

Local variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed RAII, which is widely used in C++.

Member variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an "automatic object" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.

Temporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the ; at the end of a statement).

Metaprogramming
Reflection 
Mock Object 

Reflection makes a language more suited to network-oriented code. For example, it assists languages such as Java to 
operate well in networks by enabling libraries for serialization, bundling and varying data formats. 
Languages without reflection (e.g. C) have to use auxiliary compilers, e.g. for Abstract Syntax Notation,
 to produce code for serialization and bundling.
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

// Without reflection
Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.hello();

// With reflection
try{
    
    // Alternatively: Object foo = Foo.class.newInstance();
    Object foo = Class.forName("complete.classpath.and.Foo").newInstance();
    
    Method m = foo.getClass().getDeclaredMethod("hello", new Class<?>[0]);
    m.invoke(foo);

}catch(Exception e){

    //Catching ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchMethodException
    //InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException

}

CPP  history - he motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD. thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.[13] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced C++, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
Point:-Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.[14]
Point:-In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C), adding new features that included virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//).
In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991.[16] New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a boolean type.

After the 2.0 update, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17, and further changes planned for 2020.[17]

Semaphore
wait(Semaphore s){
    while (s==0);    /* wait until s>0 */
    s=s-1;
}
signal(Semaphore s){
    s=s+1;
}

Init(Semaphore s , Int v){
    s=v;
}
Disadvantage
As shown in the examples above, processes waiting on a semaphore must constantly check to see if the semaphore is not zero. This continual looping is clearly a problem in a real multiprogramming system (where often a single CPU is shared among multiple processes). This is called busy waiting and it wastes CPU cycles. When a semaphore does this, it is called a spinlock.
Solution
To avoid busy waiting, a semaphore may use an associated queue of processes that are waiting on the semaphore, allowing the 
semaphore to block the process and then wake it when the semaphore is incremented. The operating system may provide the block() 
system call, which suspends the process that calls it, and the wakeup(P <Process>) system call which resumes the execution of blocked process P.
If a process calls wait() on a semaphore with a value of zero, the process is added to the semaphore’s queue and then blocked. 
The state of the process is switched to the waiting state, and control is transferred to the CPU scheduler, which selects another
process to execute. When another process increments 
the semaphore by calling signal() and there are tasks on the queue, one is taken off of it and resumed
wait(Semaphore s){
    s=s-1;
    if (s<0) {
        // add process to queue
        block();
    }
}

signal(Semaphore s){
    s=s+1;
    if (s<=0) {
        // remove process p from queue
        wakeup(p);
    }
}

Init(Semaphore s , Int v){
    s=v;
}
wait(2)  vs wait(3) vs SEM_WAIT(3)

mistake 1 not reading code carefully. consider each variable while analysing code.. never skip lines while reading them(sscanf)
mistake 2 always check variable format specification while printing it, analyse code again and again carefully(char vs unsigned char string)
mistake 3 always refer message specificaton while encoding or decoding (TAI and ECGI byte wise message structure)
mistake 4 format specification (singined and unsigned char)

octal - 3 bits
hexadecimal - 4 bits

we consider 3 bits for octal - 
Thus the range of signed char is -128 to 127 whereas that of unsigned char is 0 to 255.

Combining commands

Most commands accept a amount and direction, for example:

cW = change till end of word
3cW = change 3 words
BcW = to begin of full word, change full word
ciW = change inner word.
ci" = change inner between ".."
ci( = change text between ( .. )
ci< = change text between < .. > (needs set matchpairs+=<:> in vimrc)
4dd = delete 4 lines
3x = delete 3 characters.
3s = substitute 3 characters.
Useful programmer commands

r replace one character (e.g. rd replaces the current char with d).
~ changes case.
J joins two lines
Ctrl+A / Ctrl+X increments/decrements a number.
. repeat last command (a simple macro)
== fix line indent
> indent block (in visual mode)
< unindent block (in visual mode)
Macro recording

Press q[ key ] to start recording.
Then hit q to stop recording.
The macro can be played with @[ key ].

0i:r (to turn the current line into a valid :r command),
"cdd (to delete the line into the "c" register) and
@c execute that command.

0i:r (to turn the current line into a valid :r command),
"cdd (to delete the line into the "c" register) and
@c execute that command.

More powerful is the :r! command. This reads the results of a command. It's the same as suspending the vi session, running a command, 
redirecting its output to a temporary file, resuming your vi session, and reading in the contents from the temp. file.

We can use m to move lines around, and j to join lines

g/re/p (grep) was the way they documented how to "globally" "print" lines containing a "regular expression" 

The :... g and :... v commands bear some explanation as they are incredibly powerful.
 :... g is a prefix for "globally" applying a subsequent command to all lines which match a pattern (regular expression) 
 while :... v applies such a command to all lines which do NOT match the given pattern ("v" from "conVerse"). 

d/foo delete upto foo from current location in forward direction

     file systems that were improperly left locked.

     Using lockfs to lock a file system  is  discouraged  because
     this  requires  extensive knowledge of SunOS internals to be
     used effectively and correctly.
